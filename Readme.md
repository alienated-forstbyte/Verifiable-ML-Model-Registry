# Verifiable ML Model Registry

A **secure MLOps pipeline** for training, verifying, versioning, and deploying machine learning models with cryptographic integrity checks.

This project demonstrates how to build a **production-style ML pipeline** with:

- Automated model training
- Model integrity verification
- Model lineage tracking
- Containerized deployment
- CI/CD automation
- Model registry management

The system ensures that trained models **cannot be tampered with without detection**.

# Key Features

## Model Integrity Verification

Each trained model is hashed using **SHA-256**.

```

model.pkl
↓
SHA256 hash
↓
stored in model registry

```

At deployment time the hash is verified to ensure the model has **not been modified**.

---

## Model Registry

The project maintains a registry file:

```

model_registry.json

````

Example:

```json
{
  "spam_classifier": {
    "version": "1.0",
    "model_path": "models/spam_classifier_v1.0.pkl",
    "model_sha256": "...",
    "dataset_sha256": "...",
    "training_code_sha256": "...",
    "created_at": "2026-03-12T10:00:00Z"
  }
}
````

This provides full **model lineage tracking**.

---

## Model Lineage Tracking

Each training run records:

* model hash
* dataset hash
* training code hash
* timestamp
* version

This allows complete reproducibility of models.

---

## CI/CD Pipeline

GitHub Actions automatically performs:

```
git push
   ↓
install dependencies
   ↓
run training pipeline
   ↓
generate model + hashes
   ↓
update registry
   ↓
build docker image
   ↓
push to DockerHub
```

---

## Containerized Deployment

The inference API is packaged as a Docker container.

Run locally:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 <dockerhub-username>/ml-secure-api
```

API documentation:

```
http://localhost:8000/docs
```

# Running Locally

## 1 Install Dependencies

```
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 2 Run Training Pipeline

```
bash
python -m pipeline.train_pipeline
```

This will:

* Train the model
* Compute hashes
* Update the registry

---

## 3 Run the API

```bash
uvicorn api.main:app --reload
```

Open:

```
http://localhost:8000/docs
```

---

# Running with Docker

Build container:

```bash
docker build -t ml-secure-api .
```

Run container:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 ml-secure-api
```

---

# Example Prediction

Input:

```
free lottery win money now
```

Response:

```json
{
  "prediction": "spam"
}
```

---

# Security Model

The system verifies model integrity using **cryptographic hashing**.

Verification flow:

```
model file
   ↓
compute SHA256
   ↓
compare with registry
   ↓
load model if valid
```

If hashes do not match the API refuses to load the model.

---

# Future Improvements

Potential extensions:

* Blockchain-based model registry
* Model drift detection
* Automated retraining
* Feature store integration
* MLflow tracking server
* Kubernetes deployment
